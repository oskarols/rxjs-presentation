# Rxjs versions

That the newest is kind of different (how?)

https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/MIGRATION.md

* Promises
Single value
Guaranteed asynchrony (show example)
Immutable

* Promises cannot be cancelled

# Moving Parts

* Observable
represents the idea of an invokable collection of future values or events
steam of zero, one or more values
over amount of time

* Observer
is a collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delivered by the Observable

* Subscription
represents the execution of an Observable, is primarily useful for cancelling the execution



* Sync vs Async (compare with Promises)

Observable transformation
* No intermediate arrays

* Marble diagram


# Testing

* Testing is not complete in rxjs
* Internally using marble diagrams for easy testing
*

# Debugging

.do(x => console.log(x))


FAQ

* I want to do X. How do I do it?

* Do I have to use rxjs with Angular?
